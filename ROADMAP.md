# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the Anki Plattform. Our goal is to create the ultimate vocabulary learning experience, and this roadmap will guide us on our journey.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

*   **Direct Anki Account Management:** This is our highest priority. We will build a secure client that allows users to log in to their Anki accounts directly from our platform, eliminating the need for the AnkiConnect plugin.
*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** We will develop a comprehensive test suite with at least 80% code coverage to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
*   **Improved User Interface:** We will redesign the UI to be more user-friendly, intuitive, and mobile-responsive.
*   **Security Audit:** We will conduct a thorough security audit to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

## Medium-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

*   **Automated & Personalized Learning:** We will leverage AI to create personalized learning plans for each user. The platform will automatically introduce new vocabulary based on the user's learning goals and progress.
*   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** We will enhance our AI-powered content generation to provide more context and depth for each vocabulary word. This will include:
    *   Multiple example sentences.
    *   Conjugations and verb forms.
    *   Synonyms and antonyms.
    *   The ability to request vocabulary for specific situations (e.g., "vocabulary for a business dinner").
*   **Full Card Customization:** We will give users the ability to fully customize their flashcards with additional examples, images, and personal notes.

## Long-Term Goals (12+ Months)

*   **Mobile App:** We will develop a native mobile app for iOS and Android to provide a seamless learning experience on the go.
*   **Community Features:** We will build a community around the platform where users can share their custom prompts, vocabulary lists, and learning experiences.
*   **Gamification:** We will introduce gamification elements to make learning more engaging and fun.

We are excited about the future of the Anki Plattform and welcome contributions from the community to help us achieve our goals. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how you can get involved.
